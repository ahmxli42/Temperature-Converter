# Temperature-Converter
This Java program creates a simple graphical user interface (GUI) for temperature conversion using `JFrame` from the Swing library. When the program runs, it first shows a screen where the user can select one of six conversion options, such as Celsius to Fahrenheit or Kelvin to Celsius, from a dropdown menu. After selecting an option and clicking the "Next" button, the user is taken to a second screen where they can enter a temperature value. Upon clicking the "Convert" button, the program calculates the converted temperature based on the selected option using appropriate formulas. The converted value is displayed in an output text field, and both the input and output temperatures, along with the conversion type, are saved in a file named `conversion_history.txt`. The program handles invalid inputs (non-numeric entries) by showing an error message. Overall, it uses layouts, action listeners, and helper methods for each conversion type to provide a smooth and interactive temperature conversion experience.
